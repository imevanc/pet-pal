        <h3>Liability</h3>
        <p>
          Our website and the materials on our website are provided on an 'as
          is' basis. To the extent permitted by law, Pet-Pal makes no
          warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all
          other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or
          conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
          non-infringement of intellectual property, or other violation of
          rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          In no event shall Pet-Pal or its suppliers be liable for any
          consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third party
          arising from the use or inability to use this website or the materials
          on this website, even if Pet-Pal or an authorised representative has
          been notified, orally or in writing, of the possibility of such
          damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the context of this agreement, “consequential loss” includes any

          loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss of use

        <p>
          Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
          warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
          incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
