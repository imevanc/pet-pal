      <h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
      <p>
        A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device
        when you visit. It typically contains information about the website
        itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web
        browser when you return, additional data that serves the cookie’s
        purpose, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg logging in), track site
        usage (eg analytics), store your user settings (eg time zone,
        notification preferences), and to personalise your content (eg
        advertising, language).
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies set by the website you are visiting are usually referred to as
        first-party cookies. They typically only track your activity on that
        particular site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies set by other sites and companies (i.e. third parties) are called
        third-party cookies They can be used to track you on other websites that
        use the same third-party service.

        use them to deliver targeted advertising or limit the number of times
        you see an advertisement. This helps companies improve the effectiveness
        of their campaigns and the quality of content presented to you. These
